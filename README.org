erc-crypt.el is a minor mode for ERC that enables the use of PSK encryption.

Encryption can be enabled/disabled on a per buffer basis.

* Features
  - Use external OpenSSL binary for encrypt/decrypt
  - Visual in-buffer indicator for errors and encrypted messages
    sent/received
  - Auto splits ciphertext in order to get around IRC message limits.
    Original formatting is preserved, no information is lost.
  - Messages are padded to constant size


* Todo
  + Key-exchange?

* Usage 
  ;; Move erc-crypt.el to a directory in your load-path

  (require 'erc-crypt)

  M-x erc-crypt-enable  ; Enable encryption for the current ERC buffer

  M-x erc-crypt-disable ; Disable encryption for the current ERC buffer

  M-x erc-crypt-set-key ; Set/change key for current ERC buffer
