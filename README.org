erc-crypt.el is a minor mode for ERC that enables the use of PSK encryption.

Encryption can be enabled/disabled on a per buffer basis.

* Features
  - Use external OpenSSL binary for encrypt/decrypt
  - Visual in-buffer indicator for errors and encrypted messages sent/received

* Todo
  + Auto split ciphertext in order to get around IRC message limits
  + Key-exchange?
  + Message padding to constant size

* Usage 
  ;; Move erc-crypt.el to a directory in your load-path

  (require 'erc-crypt)

  M-x erc-crypt-enable  ; Enable encryption for the current ERC buffer

  M-x erc-crypt-disable ; Disable encryption for the current ERC buffer

  M-x erc-crypt-set-key ; Set/change key for current ERC buffer
